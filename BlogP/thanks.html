            <h2><a href="#">A SIMPLE TRICK TO MAKE TEACHERS HAPPY</a></h2>
            <p>
              As a teacher, when you are in the office or classroom, and you
              get a call from the school administration that a parent needs
              your attention, these calls usually require that you abandon
              all you are doing to attend to the need of the parent. Often
              time there is a complaint.
            </p>
            <p>An example of a personal encounter with a parent goes; thus,</p>
            <p class="why"><strong>“why did my son miss 2 marks in your subject, he got 60 out of 60 in other subjects why did he get 58 in yours?”</strong>These are some of the questions that parents bring to school and you have to abandon all you are doing to defend questions such as this.
            </p>
            <p>There are important observations as well that requires a collective conversation between the teacher and the parent.</p>
            <p class="text-center">So, it is perfectly all right for parents to be concerned about the learning journey of their children and by extension engage the teacher about it.</p>
            <p>Although, it can be overwhelming on the part of the teachers because they have to continually defend their actions in the classroom to a parent who is probably a Lawyer but completely has no clue about the technicalities of teaching. Anyway, it is our job, we must do it and we are perfectly ok with that.</p>
            <p>However, it will be nice if parents can come to school occasionally, just to appreciate the teachers.</p>
            <p class="gift"><strong><em>You don’t have to come with gifts, just come to appreciate us for the noticeable progress in your child.</em></strong></p>
            <p>This way, the equation will be balanced, and teachers will feel even more motivated. The situation where the only thing that got you agitated is the missed 2 marks and you are not excited to the extent of appreciation when your child can now read, solve algebra, draw, etc. is not a fair situation on our part. Your thank you shows that someone cares and more importantly,<strong>YOU care.</strong></p>
            <p>While it is not necessarily a responsibility, for you to appreciate us, after all, you paid the school for the service, it is an icing on the cake that worth the effort.</p>
            <p>Therefore, don’t just go to complain, sometimes, take time to drive down to appreciate. Just say thank you. This will go a long way to further motivate the teacher and the effect will be felt in the performance of your child.</p>
